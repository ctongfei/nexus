Nexus is a prototypical typesafe deep learning system in Scala.

Nexus is a departure from common deep learning libraries such as [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org), [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org), [MXNet](http://mxnet.io), etc. 

 - Ever been baffled by the axes of tensors? Which axis should I max out? 
 - Ever got `TypeError`s in Python?
 - Ever spending hours or days getting the tensors' axes and dimensions right?

Nexus' answer to these problems is **static types**. By specifying tensor axes' semantics in  types exploiting Scala's expressive types, compilers can validate the program **at compile time**, freeing developers' burden of remembering axes by heart, and eliminating nearly all errors above before even running.
 
Nexus embraces **declarative** and **functional** programming: Neural networks are built using small composable components, making code very easy to follow, understand and maintain.

### A first glance

A simple neural network for learning the XOR function can be found [**here**](https://github.com/ctongfei/nexus/blob/master/jvm-ref/backend/src/test/scala/nexus/XorTest.scala).

Building a typesafe XOR network:
```scala
  class In extends Dim;     val In = new In          
  class Hidden extends Dim; val Hidden = new Hidden
  class Out extends Dim;    val Out = new Out // tensor axis labels declared as types and singletons

  val x = Input[FloatTensor[In]]()     // input vectors
  val y = Input[FloatTensor[Out]]()    // gold labels

 Â val Å· = x Â  Â  Â  Â  Â   Â  Â  Â  Â   Â  |>   // type: Symbolic[FloatTensor[In]]
    Affine(In -> 2, Hidden -> 2)  |>   // type: Symbolic[FloatTensor[Hidden]]
    Logistic                      |>   // type: Symbolic[FloatTensor[Hidden]]
    Affine(Hidden -> 2, Out -> 2) |>   // type: Symbolic[FloatTensor[Out]]
    Softmax                            // type: Symbolic[FloatTensor[Out]]
 Â val loss = CrossEntropy(y, Å·)      Â  // type: Symbolic[Float]
``` 

### Design goals

 - **Typeful**. Each axis of a tensor is statically typed using tuples. For example, an image is typed as `FloatTensor[(Width, Height, Channel)]`, whereas an embedded sentence is typed as `FloatTensor[(Word, Embedding)]`. This frees programmers from remembering what each axis stands for.
 - **Typesafe**.  Very strong static type checking to eliminate most bugs at compile time.
 - **Never, ever specify axis index again**. For things like `reduce_sum(x, axis=1)`, write `x |> SumAlong(AxisName)`.
 - **Automatic typeclass derivation**: Differentiation through any case class (product type).
 - **Versatile switching between eager and lazy evaluation**.
 - **[TODO] Typesafe tensor sizes using literal singleton types (Scala 2.13+)**. 
 - **[TODO] Automatic batching over sequences/trees** (Neubig, Goldberg, Dyer, NIPS 2017). Free programmers from the pain of manual batching.
 - **[TODO] GPU Acceleration**. Reuse `Torch` C++ core through Swig [(bindings)](https://github.com/ctongfei/JTorch).
 - **[TODO] Multiple backends**. Torch / MXNet? / TensorFlow.js for Scala.js? / libtorch for ScalaNative?
 - **[TODO] Automatic operator fusion for optimization.**
 - **[TODO] Typesafe higher-order gradients / Jacobians**.
